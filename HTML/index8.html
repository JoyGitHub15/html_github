  <blockquote>
   Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”

This famous quote by Winston Churchill has much meaning today. Although we may have achieved our new first job or got promoted after ten years in the profession, we must continually strive for more. At this juncture, it is vital to answer the question: WHY. What am I striving for? In Churchill's case, it was to be at the center of change and to provide leadership in a troubled time.  Complacency is a killer in any line of work. As I have written in the past, the best antidote to complacency is disciplined work. 
The key to success is never to stop learning, never stop networking, and never stop growing.  Don’t settle for 'good enough' when you can achieve much more. Keep pushing your limits, and you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish.
